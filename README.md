# Predict-Employee-Turnover-with-scikit-learn
Predict Employee Churn with Decision Trees and Random Forests

Employee turnover analytics is the process of assessing your turnover rates in an attempt to predict and reduce future employee turnover. Machine Learning models can enable companies to identify variables and features and also bonuses and incentives that predict turnover within their own organization and business.

The dataset contains employeesâ€™ profiles of a large companies where each row is a data of unique employee. The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle but initially put together by a very large multinational corporation.

### The key objective of this project is to learn the following skills:
1.	Apply decision trees and random forests with scikit-learn to classification problems.
2.	Interpret decision trees and random forest models using feature importance plots.
3.	Tune model hyperparamters to improve classification accuracy.
4.	Create interactive, GUI components in Jupyter notebooks using widgets.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Import Libraries
- __Task 2:__ Exploratory Data Analysis
- __Task 3:__ Encode Categorical Features
- __Task 4:__ Visualize Class Imbalance
- __Task 5:__ Create Training and Test Sets
- __Task 6 & 7:__ Build a Decision Tree Classifier with Interactive Controls
- __Task 8:__ Build a Random Forest Classifier with Interactive Controls
- __Task 9:__ Feature Importance Plots and Evaluation Metrics
